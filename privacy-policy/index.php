                Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of

                Once we have received your information, we will take appropriate technical and organizational measures
                to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorized use, access or modification.
            </p>
            <p>When we collect financial account information, such as credit card numbers, we protect its transmission

                cancel your account, please follow the instructions found in the terms of service for the applicable
                Service. You may still receive marketing communications from us even after you cancel your account
